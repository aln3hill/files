Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode allows the programmers to outline the algorithms they need to write before they actually starts to code. This gives them a better overview and understanding of the program
and helps them to code a correct program quicker. 

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
It would results in errors since pseudocode is not meant to be read by computers, but by humans. 

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION greaterThan(numberOne, numberTwo)
  IF numberOne is greater than numberTwo
	PRINT numberOne
  
  ELSE PRINT numberTwo

  END IF
END

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION printNumbers
  FOR EACH number between 1 and 100
	PRINT number
  END FOR
END

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION findEntry(entry, phonebook)
  FOR EACH element in phonebook
	IF entry = element
	RETURN true
  	
	END IF
  END FOR

  RETURN false	
	
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findEntry(entry, phonebook){
  for (let i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
    if(entry === phonebook[i]){
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
